orgsync-devtest
===============

####Welcome to the OrgSync UI/Frontend Devtest.

The file index.html has some very basic information on it about an event that exists in a portal (an organization) in OrgSync.

### The Objective:

Design a responsive "show" view for this event. Which means a page that will be accessed by the daily average user when they're looking for information about an event. They could have reached this page from a number of different routes (or devices) but their goal is to learn more about an event and to possibly take action upon that event.

We have started you off with some of the pieces of information and elements our users are used to seeing on an event page but feel free to expand upon those if you see value in other types of elements. Play with the data as well if it is needed, this is a very open ended project.

There are a whole host of UI questions to consider on something like this , questions you might ask of the client (or the userbase) about needs -- we realize that and don't expect you to build something that would immediately fit into the OrgSync system but please explain some of your thoughts going into the creation of this page. (You can leave comments in your commit messages, below in this README file or in your HTML as you go along).

### How To Start

You can get this code to us however you feel most comfortable, here is one way:

First you will want to clone this repository to your local machine so you can edit it.


#### How to clone this repo:

Using terminal go to a folder in your computer where you would like to create this project. type `git clone https://github.com/tylerlee/orgsync-ui-design-test.git` that will create a folder called "orgsync-ui-design-test" that you can jump into and see the contents of. 

We want to create another branch so after your in the directory type `git branch valarie` to create a branch named valarie, and `git checkout valarie` to jump into that branch.

From here you can make all of your changes, write your code etc... Add and Commit your changes like you normally would.
If you are able to make incremental commits to show how your code progresses that would be helpful (but not required). When you are finished you will need to push your changes out so `git push origin valarie` will push to github.

Again, this is open ended, use anything you would like to accomplish this project, our goal for this project is to ascertain both development skills and design/UI considerations. If you have any further questions feel free to ask: tyler@orgsync.com, kevin@orgsync.com, clifton@orgsync.com
